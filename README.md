# iOS development assignment.

I'd like to introduce you to my first iOS assignment. 
I had to develop a travel location app where users can save sites and also search for saved places by name, address and saved date. 
The app must have a login and register screen. And it also must look good for iPhone and iPad in portrait and landscape layouts.
The challenges I faced:
- Using Mac! It is so hard to switch between Windows and Mac and try to adapt to shortcodes like Ctrl-C and Command-C quickly.
- Setting up constraints to everything, especially to scroll view. Only with good constraints, it can look good on different devices.
-Code extraction from view components to reusable blocks. Still have to work on it.
